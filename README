Known Limitations:-

1. The pre-saved map is not yet post-processed with keep-out zones 
    and so the obstacle avoidance may be challenging sometimes.
2. The Odometry message does not give the twist velocity info and so estimation is done during navigation.
3. Initial pose estimation is done with the reinitialize_global_localization 
   but the observed output may still be off sometimes.
